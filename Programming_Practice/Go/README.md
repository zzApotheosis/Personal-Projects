# Golang Practice

This is my personal repository for my practice with Google's amazing programming language, Go. I plan to become very skilled with this language, and add it to my increasingly growing skillset of languages, including C/++, Java, Python, Assembly, Lua, Verilog HDL, and BASH, among others.
