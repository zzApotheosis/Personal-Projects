# GnuTLS
Use `$ certtool` to generate the keys and X.509 certificates needed to create a valid X.509 trust structure for use with these example implementations (almost entirely based on the official examples found in the upstream GnuTLS project). For convenience, I have already provided a sample set of keys and certificates in the `src` directory.
