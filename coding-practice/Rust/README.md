# Rust
The Rust programming language is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. This repository serves as my personal collection of practice code I've written as a means to learn Rust.

The basics of Rust are documented in the Rust By Example book, which can be found online at: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/
