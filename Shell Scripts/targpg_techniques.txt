This technique requires a GnuPG keypair, which can be created with:
gpg --full-generate-key

To encrypt:
tar -czv <files and directories> | gpg -se --cipher-algo AES256 -r <recipients' public keys, usually identified by their name or email address; for me, it's zzApotheosis@gmail.com> -o <archivefile.tar.gz.gpg>

To decrypt:
gpg -d <archivefile.tar.gz.gpg> | tar -xzv
