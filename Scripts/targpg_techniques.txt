This technique requires a GnuPG keypair, which can be created with:
gpg --full-generate-key

To encrypt:
tar -cz <files and directories> | gpg -se --cipher-algo AES256 -r <recipients' public keys, usually identified by their name or email address; for me, it's zzApotheosis@gmail.com> -o <archivefile.tar.gz.gpg>

To decrypt:
gpg -d <archivefile.tar.gz.gpg> | tar -xz

To export a key(pair):
gpg --export-secret-key --armor <key ID, or name, or email address> > ./key.asc

To import a key(pair):
gpg --import <key file>

To recognize an imported key as ultimately trusted:
gpg --edit <key ID, or name, or email address>
Then enter "trust" at the prompt to enter trust level.
