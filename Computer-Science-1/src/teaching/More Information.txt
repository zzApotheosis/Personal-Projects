For more information about Java and Computer Science in general, my favorite
places to find general information have been StackOverflow, Wikipedia, YouTube,
HackerRank, and open-source repositories on GitHub.


Here's a laundry list of helpful links.

This website helped me out so much. Once I had enough experience in Java, going through
the "30 Days of Code" challenge on HackerRank accelerated my knowledge of Java, and
Computer Science in general.

YouTube user blondiebytes (Kathryn Hodge) is one of the people who helped launch HackerRank's
30 Days of Code program, and she has VERY helpful, informative YouTube tutorials on each
challenge in the 30 Days of Code course.

Here's the link to all of my personal work, open-sourced. DO NOT plagiarize my code (or anyone's).
Metropolitan State University of Denver holds a high standard of academic integrity, and
will not hesitate to give you the boot should you go down the dark path that is plagiarism.
Also be warned, most of my work is licensed (all of my CS1 work), and therefore copyrighted to me.
I am giving you permission to use my code for reference, and to further your understanding
