# Ada
The Gnu Compiler Collection has examples and documentation for building basic Ada programs.

On a side note, this is purely for educational purposes. In my opinion, no new program should ever be written in Ada. New programs and implementations should use the correct tool for the job which almost never includes Ada. My personal favorite languages are the C family of languages, mostly C and C++.
