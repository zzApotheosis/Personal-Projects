Probably the best way to generate secure passwords that I know of. This is assuming the Linux kernel's pseudorandom RNG is cryptographically secure.
cat /dev/random | tr -dc "[:graph:]" | head -c <length>

Replace <length> with the length of your desired password. This will generate a password containing all printable characters (excluding whitespace) of <length> length.
Replace "[:graph:]" with another character set of choice. See the man page for the tr command: man tr
